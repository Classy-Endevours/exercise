 * ===== Question 2 [8 points] =====
 * The variable colorMap contains a Map
 * - the keys in the folder are names of colours,
 * - the values are strings containing the hexadecimal code of the colour.
 *
 * The hexadecimal code of a colour is as follows: '#rrggbb',
 * where rr, gg, bb are two hexadecimal digits that represent the red, green and blue component respectively.
 * contain the red, green and blue component of a colour.
 *
 * The variable colorObject is a small object that represents a colour.
 *
 * The variable colorName contains the name of a colour.
 *
 * Solve subquestions 2.1 to 2.3 below.

// 2.1 Add the colour as defined in colorObject to colorMap

/* 2.1 Solution */

// 2.2 Change colorObject so that the object's properties contain the
// data for the colour with the name from the variable colorName.
// Get the data from colorMap. You may assume that the colour is present in the colorMap.

/* 2.2 Solution */

// 2.3 The giveNamesOfColorsWithGreenComponent(colorMap) function should return an
// array with the names of all colours from colorMap that have a green component.
// component, i.e. the digits for the green component are different from '00'.
